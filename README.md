# Exercise I

Remarks:Always explain, or prove if necessary, the correctness of your analysis or claims.

```
Question 1:
```
1. How many different Vigenere keys of length 4 are there for coding the English
    alphabet? The last string must be of size 2 to get to 26.
2. Say you have annblock of bits message. You split it to 8 bits each (assume that
    8 dividesn). For each of the 8 bit we choose a permutation of the bits. How
    many different codes could come out of this?
3. For any two bitsxi, yi, definexiXOR yi=xi+yimod2. For two vectors,v, u,
    definev XOR u to be the vector whosei-th bit isuiXOR vi. Say that the
    plaintext hasxbits. For the cyphertext we randomly select a random numberr
    withxbits, (this means that all of the 2xvectors withxbits, have probability
    1 / 2 xto be selected). For a vectoru, our code message isx XOR rIn aknown
    plaintextattack how would you discover the keyr.

```
Question 2:
```
1. Show that if a number ends with the digit 1, then all power of this number end
    with 1
2. Show that any number that ends in 9 if squared ends at 1.
3. Show that 1001^978 − 34292 is divisible by 10.

```
Question 3:Apply the simple GCD algorithm for
```
1. a= 112, b= 32
2. a= 114, b= 68

```
Question 4:For the twoa, bin exercise 3, find thex, yso thatx·a+y·b=gcd(a, b) using
the generalized gcd algorithm.
```
```

9 x= 15mod30.
Find all solutions.
